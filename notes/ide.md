Things people like about IDEs
=============================
These are just some things that people seem to like about IDEs, organized by the languages that those people write with them.

* Quickly navigating to a type without needing to worry about namespace, project etc
* Navigating to members by treating them as hyperlinks
* Autocompletion when you can't remember the names of all members by heart
* Automatic code generation
* Refactoring (massive one)
* Organise imports (automatically adding appropriate imports in Java, using directives in C#)
* Warning-as-you-type (i.e. some errors don't even require a compile cycle)
* Hovering over something to see the docs
* Keeping a view of files, errors/warnings/console/unit tests etc and source code all on the screen at the same time in a useful way
* Ease of running unit tests from the same window
* Integrated debugging
* Integrated source control
* Navigating to where a compile-time error or run-time exception occurred directly from the error details.
* Discoverability "I want to be able to download a library (through whatever means), and then figure out how to use it from within my code."
* "I can work completely without a mouse."
* Extensibility "Imagine a programming language in which you can't write your own functions. You wouldn't want to use that, would you?"
* RegEx-based find/replace
* Code-collapse
* A "Birds eye view"

Things I think are important (in order greatest to least)
---------------------------------------------------------
1) Extensibility
2) Warnings & errors asap
3) Autocomplete
4) Syntax or context/closure level highlighting

As long as 1 gets done 2-4+ should be just a matter of writing plugins. 

I'd like to get a list of some really space-aged ideas that would increase productivity here.
